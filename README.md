denite-nerdfont
===============

A [denite](https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim) source for looking up icons
in the [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) set.

## Installation

Install this plugin with your preferred vim plugin manager.

## Collection updates

Currently, the icon index file is baked into the repository. As such, you will
need to pull this repo to get updated indices of the Nerd Font collections. If
you're using a package manager, this should be a painless process. In the
future, I'd like to make it dynamically download the Nerd Font collection
information and parse it from there.
